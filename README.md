# MavPaths
## Explanation of project
This project is designed in two major parts: A frontend page hosting the MavPaths project that allows a student to clearly see how their credits will transfer from a college to UNO, and a second part that will help automatically recommend a path to the student which is currently under development.
## Installation Instructions
This is a fairly straightforward C# project built on top of .NET. The basic instructions for a VS Code user can be found [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp)
At the end of the day, as long as you have the latest stable release of .NET installed, and have the C# tools installed on your machine you should be good to go.
